# Biometric-Facial-Recognition

Face recognition is a biometric technology with a wide
range of potential applications such as access control, banking,
information security, human computer interaction, virtual
reality, database retrieval etc. Face recognition system should be
able to automatically detect a face in images. This involves
extraction of its features and then recognizes it, regardless of
lighting, ageing, occlusion, expression, illumination and pose.
Principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis
are tested and compared for the face recognition of facial images
database. The proposed algorithm is based on the measure of the
principal components of the faces and also to find the shortest
distance between them.
